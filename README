NAME
    AnyEvent::BDB - truly asynchronous berkeley db access

SYNOPSIS
       use AnyEvent::BDB;
       use BDB;

       # can now use any of the requests your BDB module supports
       # as long as you use an event loop supported by AnyEvent.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is an AnyEvent user, you need to make sure that you use and
    run a supported event loop.

    Loading this module will install the necessary magic to seamlessly
    integrate BDB into AnyEvent, i.e. you no longer need to concern yourself
    with calling "BDB::poll_cb" or any of that stuff (you still can, but
    this module will do it in case you don't).

    The AnyEvent watcher can be disabled by executing "undef
    $AnyEvent::BDB::WATCHER". Please notify the author of when and why you
    think this was necessary.

SEE ALSO
    AnyEvent, Coro::BDB (for a more natural syntax).
